A MassTransit sample to test how message size affects throughput.

Uses RabbitMQ as the transport and Autofac for Dependency Injection.

Building:
Open the solution, get the packages, build.

Running:
From build_output, start the consumer:
 throughput.test.consumer.exe 
Then the Publisher:
